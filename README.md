  let error_prefix = "❌  "

  let error_style = Style.make [ Style.bold; Style.color Red ]

  let selected_style = Style.make [ Style.bold; Style.color Blue ]

  Lwt_main.run result
```

## Contributing

### Developing

You need Opam, you can install it by following [Opam's documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

With Opam installed, you can build the project with:

```bash
make
```

### Running Examples

After building the project, you can run the example binaries with:

```bash
dune exec examples/<example>.exe
```

For instance, to run the `confirm.ml` example, you can type:

```bash
dune exec examples/confirm.exe
```

### Running Tests

You can test compiled executable with:

```bash
make test
```

### Building documentation

Documentation for the libraries in the project can be generated with:

```bash
make doc
open-cli _build/default/_doc/_html/index.html
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open _build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`

### Create new releases

To create a release and publish it on Opam, you can run the script `scripts/release.sh`. It will create a tag with the version found in `inquire.opam`, and push it on your repository.

From there, the CI/CD will take care of publishing your documentation, create a github release, and open a PR with your version on `opam-repository`.
